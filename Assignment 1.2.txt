2. You have 25 excel files with names as xx_1.xlsx, xx_2.xlsx,........xx_25.xlsx in a dir.
Write a program to extract the contents of each excel sheet and make it one df.

Answer :
f = list.files("./")
dat = lapply(f, function(i){
    x = read.xlsx(i, sheetIndex=1, sheetName=NULL, startRow=5,
        endRow=NULL, as.data.frame=TRUE, header=T)
    x = x[, c(1, 3, 5)]
    x$file = i
    x
})
df = do.call("rbind.data.frame", dat)

3. If the above 25 files were csv files, what would be your script to read?
Answer:
multmerge = function(mypath){
filenames=list.files(path=mypath, full.names=TRUE)
datalist = lapply(filenames, function(x){read.csv(file=x,header=T)})
Reduce(function(x,y) {merge(x,y)}, datalist)

where mypath = the name of a folder that contains all of the csv files
